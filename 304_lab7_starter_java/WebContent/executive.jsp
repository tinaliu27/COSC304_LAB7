        <h1><i>Executive Summary</i></h1>
        <p>At RockPalz, we offer a diverse range of pet rocks to complement a programmer&apos;s needs. As aspiring programmers, we understand the struggle of not being able to hang out with your friends due to assignments or labs. As a result, we have decided to take a nostalgic and iconic toy and offer it as a new friend so programmers can have a friend as they code. </p>
        <p>Our company is currently located in Kelowna, BC, but we hope to make a difference worldwide. We plan to collaborate with companies in the United States such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, etc. to replace coding ducks with pet rocks. Our inspiration behind pet rocks stems from a sustainability perspective. For instance, coding ducks are made up of harmful plastics which form massive &apos;garbage patches&apos; in the ocean as well as harming the environment for many animals. As a result, through RockPalz, we plan to replace coding ducks by offering a more sustainable option. We plan to use naturally produced rocks here at the Okanagan to ensure that we meet our sustainability goals. </p>
        <p>On our website, users have a variety of pet rocks to choose from including Celebrity Lookalikes, Professor Lookalikes, Pet rocks kits, and so much more. Users have the ability to purchase these rocks anywhere in the world via our website. To add on to that, users may review our products, see their previous orders, and login with a personalized username and password. </p>
        <p>In this report, we explain the features and designs implemented by Noah Stasuik and Tina Liu. We hope users take advantage of all the different features and join us in our plan to make pet rocks your newest best friend. </p>
